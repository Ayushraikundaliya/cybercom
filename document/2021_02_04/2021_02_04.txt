Hey! There?
-> Ayush this side ...

#Database

-> To connect to a MySQL Serve : $con = mysqli_connect("hostname","username","password","dbname");

-> To execute a query : $query_exec = mysqli_query($con,'your_query');

-> To get tables from database as associative array : mysqli_fetch_assoc($query_exec);

-> LEFT JOIN : It returns all the rows from left table, even if there are no matches in the right table.
	       -> This means that if the ON clause matches 0 records in the right table; the join will still return a row in the result,
	       -> but with NULL in each column from the right table.
	       -> select table1.column1,table2.column2...
		  from table1
		  left join table2
		  ON table1.common_field = table2.common_field;

-> RIGHT JOIN : It returns all the rows from right table, even if there are no matches in the left table.
	       -> This means that if the ON clause matches 0 records in the left table; the join will still return a row in the result,
	       -> but with NULL in each column from the left table.
	       -> select table1.column1,table2.column2...
		  from table1
		  right join table2
		  ON table1.common_field = table2.common_field;

-> LIKE : It is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.
	-> There are two wildcards often used in conjuction with the LIKE operator.
	  1) % - represents zero,one or multiple characters.
	  2) _ - represents a single character.
	-> select column_name from table_name where like %your_string;

-> DISTINCT : It is used to not print the duplicate values.


That's all for today ...
