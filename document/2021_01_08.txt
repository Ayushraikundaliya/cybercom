Hey! There?
-> Ayush this side.

Today, We will learn new concept i.e, javascript.

**Javascript

-> One of the core technology in web deveplopment
-> cross-platform(can be used in multiple platform),OOP language.
-> Client-side language
-> Server-side (node.js)

**Libraries based on js 

-> React
-> Angular
-> jQuery


HTML - content
CSS - presentation
javascript - programming/dynamic effects


**To declare a variable we use 'var' keyword
-> var firstname = 'john';


**Primitive Datatypes in javascript

1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean
4. Undefined
5. Null


**Important**

-> Javascript has dynamic typing: data types are automatically assigned to variables.

example : var job;
	  console.log(job);
output : undefined


**Type coercion : It is the implicit conversions of values from one data type to another.


**To get a popup as a output use : alert instead of console.log

alert('Hello World');


**To get a value from the user we will use : prompt

var abc = prompt('enter your name');


**Operators in Javascripts 

1. Math operator : +,-,/,*
2. Logical operator : >,<.=
3. typeof operator : To know about the datatype of variable


Apart from this have done HTML Practice 1 and Javascript Coding 1 and Coding 2.

Thank you.

Spread learning ^_^
