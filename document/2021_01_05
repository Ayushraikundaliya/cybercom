Hey! There?
-> Ayush this side.
-> So, let's brief about what i've learned today. (Writing this would help me to recall in various  time being)

GIT - Just not a word but a whole technical industry is depend on this to share, to learn or to copy...in short it is capable of everything.

-> Distributed version Control system (where complete codebase - including its full version history - is mirrored on every developer's computer)
                                      (Changes to  files are tracked between computers)

-> It gets used in various platform like Github(most famous), Gitlab(not so famous), Bitbucket(It really is famous) and many more.

Two main keywords or terms that reflects GIT is :

1. Repository : A collection of files.
2. Branch or Trunk : If you want to work on two project simulatneously for example : you've one application of version 1.0 now you want to update it then what you will do is you will 
                     a branch and start working on that let named it as version 1.1 (this means you can able to work with version 1.0 and version 1.1 simulataneously) and once you are 
                     done with your work you can push and merge it. Main merits of this is if your version 1.1 doesn't work properly then you can shift to version 1.0 and make it more 
                     efficient than version 1.1 . 
                     
(Before moving to various command let's go through steps given in the docs)

Step 1 : Create Github Account

Step 2 : Generate SSH Key 
        2.1 -> Enter a command in git bash : ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "ayushrk09@gmail.com" 
        2.2 -> Press enter 3 times
        2.3 -> copy the ssh key using command : cat ~/.ssh/.id_rsa.pub
        2.4 -> You will get your key.
        
        But But But if we are talking about "ssh" then it would not be good if we not explain that what it is?
        -> So, ssh stands for secure shell.
        -> It helps you to connect and authenticate with servers (so that you don't need to use your username or email at each visit)
        
Before moving to step 3 let's discuss one more terms that is "Cloning" : In short, it means to copy your file or project from your local computer to Github repository and vice versa 
                                                                         to make it easier to merge,add or remove,to solve conflicts.
                                                                         
Step 3 : Cloning project in local machine
         3.1 -> Make a folder on yout machine and run git bash
         3.2 -> Create a directory using command : mkdir *name_of_your_project*
         3.3 -> Clone your reporitary using ssh key : git clone *ssh key*
