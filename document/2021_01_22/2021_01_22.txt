Hey! there?
-> Ayush this side .. 

PHP
 
-> Stands for Hypertext pre-preocessor.
-> It is a server side scripting language.
-> Extension, '.php'.


Things to remember : 


#Embedding PHP inside HTML " 

<?php
$text = "Ayush";
?>

<p><?php echo $text; ?></p>

-> Output : Ayush


#How to declare an variable :  $variable_name = value;


Rest all are same as other coding language,
if-else
if-else if
for loop
while loop
do-while loop
switch statement


That's all for today

Thank You.
