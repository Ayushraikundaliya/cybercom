Hey! There?
-> Ayush this side ...

Today we will see where we can actually use javascript (in form of project)


**DOM

-> Document Object Model
-> Strusctured representation of an HTML document.
-> It is used to connect webpages to scripts like js.
-> For each HTML box, there is an object in the DOM that we can access and interact with.

javascript ------------------------> DOM
	   Interaction/Manipulation

-> Javascript and DOM are two different things.

-> In our words, DOM is a tree structure of HTML Document or objects like how it works and to interact with js files.

**HTML DOM

-> A standard how to get,change,add or delete HTML elements.

It generally consits of two main things

1. Methods - Which is an actions we can perform.
2. Properties - Which are the values that we can set or change.

Example : 

 <html>
<body>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World!";
</script>

</body>
</html> 

Here, to access an Html element id is used. 
in above example getElementById method used id="demo" to find the element.

to ge the content of an element innerHTML is used.

in short getElementById is a Method and innerHTML is a Property.


That's all for today will go through more DOM method and property in next slide or file.


Thank you.
