Hello there?
-> Ayush this side ... 



#Arrays

$num = array(1,2,3,4,5);

Here, index will start from 0.


-> Associative array : Manual assign a key to a value.

$num = array('one'=>1,'two'=>2,'three'=>3,'four'=>4,'five'=>5);

Here, index will be the key that's in 'single quote' or before '=>' sign.


-> Multi-dimensional array 

$multi = array('odd'=>array(1,3,5),'even'=>array(2,4)); //Multidimensional Array

echo $multi['even'][1]; //output : 4

echo $multi['odd'][2]; //output : 5


#For-each 

-> It takes both key and value pair.


#include and require 

-> When we want to add html files to php page we use include and require.

-> The only one difference between these two is that when there is error in accessing html file then,
	-> In include rest all commands will executed and showed as output.
	-> In require it will only show error.



That's all for today ..

Thank You.
